### Why

Last month during a long tedious and boring [PI planning][pi-planning] team
estimation process, we decide to avoid usage of [planning poker][planning-poker]
cards and turn everything into a more dynamic and table-free method.
Everything began as a joke and we ended finishing our journey using it and
completely satisfied with the result. We called it, [*Rock Paper Scissors Lizard
Spock*][big-bang-video] planning.

### How

The method is as simple as it sounds. Everyone acts like if they were playing
and showing, at the same time, its estimations using the following game gestures
associated with *Fibonacci sequence* values.

Gesture | Value
--------|------:
Rock | 1
Scissors | 2
Spock | 3
Paper | 5
Lizard | 8

### What

The final estimation where concreted after a minimal discussion about them.
Because this estimations can not be accurate, consensus was easily obtained.

Of course, this method uses a limited set of values and maybe it will not fit
everyone needs. In our case, we rarely have more than eight points for a
history. Anyway, add some new gestures or change these for a less freak ones
do not seems like a complicated task.
